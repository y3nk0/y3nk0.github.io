###Hardware Grant Requests 
Professors, Researchers and Advisors should complete the online [Hardware Grant Request] Form to request a GPU for research purposes for themselves and/or their teams. In order to review your request, we require a proposal and CV. Your proposal must include the following:

- contact information
- a short description of your research project(s)
- how you and/or your team will use the GPU
- list of recent publications

Hardware Grant Requests are reviewed and notification takes place on a bi-weekly basis.  There is a limit of (1) GPU grant per person, per year and per project. The address in the online form should be your complete FedEx/DHL acceptable shipping address.  This is the address that will be used to ship any awarded GPU.

**Students should not submit Hardware Grant Requests.** All submissions must come from a Professor, Researcher or Advisor. If you have multiple students interested in using GPUs for their research, one submission should be made for your group keeping in mind the overall goals for the next year.

NVIDIA Academic Hardware grants are small "seeding" gifts intended to enable researchers to begin a new project and gain the preliminary results to support a larger proposal to other funding agencies. Our goal is "breadth-first" seeding and grants are for (1) GPU.  Since NVIDIA does not make complete computer systems, we do not donate them. We also do not grant large quantities of equipment or server rack mountable GPUs. If you request more than one GPU for your research or your team, be sure to clearly explain why multiple GPUs are needed in your proposal. Check out our GPU Education Center Program for details on teaching lab equipment donations.
