Trying to find th ideal place to do a CS Machine Learning Master in Europe? France is probably the best way to go. And why is that?

- widely recognized universities, especially due to strong math history
- top professors providing state-of-the-art methods and approaches
- low living cost in the education environment
- almost zero tuition fees
- possibility of scholarship given good grades and background
- beautiful French cities(Paris for my case)
- getting a good grade in the master (>=15) can get you in a PhD program

Comparing France to United Kingdom spefically, you get very high tuition fees, which in some cases are prohibitive, and a higher living cost, especially if the universities you prefer are located in London. It all boils down essentially to the language barrier. Things are a bit hard in France in case you don't speak French at all. But don't worry about that. You will get used to it.

Some Masters in french universities and grandes ecoles that are located in Paris and the greater area of Ile-de-France:

1. [MVA] - Master M2 Mathematiques/Vision/Apprentisage, ENS Cachan (Math, Computer Vision, Machine Learning)
2. [Data Science Paris-Saclay] - Data Science Master M2, Paris-Saclay Uiversity
3. [Statistics & ML] - Master M2 Statistics and Machine Learning, Paris-Saclay Uiversity
4. [MSc in AI] - MSc in Artificial Intelligence, Centrale Supelec
