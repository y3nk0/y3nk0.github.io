Work by Google AI Language based in Seattle. The authors introduce a new language representation model called [BERT], which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, [BERT] is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the [GLUE] benchmark.
