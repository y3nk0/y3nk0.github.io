A great tutorial for GANs in PyTorch. You just follow the instructions [here]. Goodfellow published many other papers on GANs, including a [2016 paper] describing some practical improvements, including the minibatch discrimination method. And here’s a [2-hour tutorial] he presented at NIPS 2016. For TensorFlow users, here’s a [parallel post] from Aylien on GANs.
