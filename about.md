I am Konstantinos Skianis, a Ph.D. Student at Ã‰cole Polytechnique working on Text & Graph Mining with applications on Machine Learning. My [academic website](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~kskianis/) has much more information. This website is inspired by [Andrej Karpathy blog](http://karpathy.github.io/).
